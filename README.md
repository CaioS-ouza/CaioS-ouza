**`Software Developer Fullstack`**

My name is Caio, I'm 19 years and natural from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I'm studing at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and looking for more knowledge in the technology area, i like this area since i was young, so i started to searching in the internet some things about computers, eletronichs, and watch tutorials of build simple lines of code and started to follow them (my first line of code was in "Portugol").At the High school i had a chance to part of a robotic team named Robot The One(Robot'One), in the school Firjan Sesi Tijuca, where i learn more of robotic, could put my hands to work and learned more about team work.
